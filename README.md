### Hi there üëã

üßë‚Äçüíª Project highlights:

- [dependency-finder](https://github.com/jeantessier/dependency-finder) - Tracking dependencies in `Java` code (what method calls other methods, what class references other classes, what package depends on what other packages) through static analysis of compiled `Java` code.
    - [micronaut-depfind-test](https://github.com/jeantessier/micronaut-depfind-test) - Dependency Finder as a Service.  An experimental microservice written in `Groovy` using the Micronaut framework.
    - [dependencyfinder-react-app](https://github.com/jeantessier/dependencyfinder-react-app) - A React frontend for the Dependency Finder service, written in `JavaScript` and plenty of React Hooks.
- [test-summary-action](https://github.com/jeantessier/test-summary-action) - An action for GitHub Actions workflows to summarize JUnit runs to the workflow's summary.
- [code-coverage-summary-action](https://github.com/jeantessier/code-coverage-summary-action) - An action for GitHub Actions workflows to summarize Jacoco code coverage runs to the workflow's summary.
- [book-reviews/node_graphql_federation](https://github.com/jeantessier/book-reviews/tree/master/node_graphql_federation) - A GraphQL backend that uses Apollo graph federation to join together GraphQL services written in `JavaScript` with Node.
    - [book-search-react-app](https://github.com/jeantessier/book-search-react-app) - A React frontend for the Book Reviews service, written in `JavaScript`, that uses GraphQL to communicate with the backend service.
- [book-reviews/rails_graphql_federation](https://github.com/jeantessier/book-reviews/tree/master/rails_graphql_federation) - A GraphQL backend that uses Apollo graph federation to join together GraphQL services written with `Ruby` on Rails.
- `TwoStageGuiceProvider` - If you're using Guice to do `Java` dependency injection, this article shows you how to chain modules together to do multi-stage initialization.  Versions with tests in [JUnit 4](https://github.com/jeantessier/TwoStageGuiceProvider-gradle-junit4), [JUnit Jupiter](https://github.com/jeantessier/TwoStageGuiceProvider-gradle-junit5), and [Spock](https://github.com/jeantessier/TwoStageGuiceProvider-gradle-spock).
- LangChain examples in [`Java`](https://github.com/jeantessier/langchain-java-example), [`JavaScript`](https://github.com/jeantessier/langchain-javascript-example), [`Python`](https://github.com/jeantessier/langchain-python-example), and [`Ruby`](https://github.com/jeantessier/langchain-ruby-example).  They can connect to ChatGPT, Claude, and Google Gemini.

‚ö° Fun fact:

- I do a lot of kendo (the martial art), but I don't know any Kendo (the UI framework).
- I've been doing [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/about) for [2023](https://github.com/jeantessier/advent-of-code-2023) and [2024](https://github.com/jeantessier/advent-of-code-2024).
